The Windows Prerequisites page may mention about Visual Studio Express 2013 and
Windows SDK 8.1. Please note that has been confirmed to build on Visual Studio
2017 and the Windows 10 1809 SDK (17763). However, this has not been tested to 
build on Visual Studio 2019/2022 with newer SDKs, but it *might* work.
